It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, with features such as sorting tasks by various criteria like deadlines, status, and overdue tasks. The application is built using Flaskfor the back-end, with PostgreSQL as the database, integrates Bootstrap for responsive front-end design, and is deployed on Render for reliable hosting. The project incorporates essential SaaS principles by offering user-friendly task management accessible from any device with an internet connection. Key features include basic user authentication, dynamic database interactions, and an intuitive interface, making it scalable and adaptable for diverse user needs. This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience in building SaaS applications, web development, database management, and user interface design.
